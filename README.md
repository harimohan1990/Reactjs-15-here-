### ✨ Introduction

React 15 was a **milestone release** that quietly laid the groundwork for what React is today. It introduced full SVG support, allowed custom DOM attributes, stabilized input elements, and split rendering logic from the core—creating a more scalable architecture.

Let’s take a detailed tour of the **key features in React 15** and why they still matter for developers today.

---

### 🧱 1. ReactDOM Introduced

React 15 introduced a dedicated rendering package:

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Why It Matters:**

* Separation of rendering logic
* Prepares React for platforms like React Native, React VR

---

### 🖼️ 2. SVG Support Improved

Before React 15, SVG properties were buggy. Now you can reliably use:

```jsx
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" strokeWidth="4" fill="yellow" />
</svg>
```

✅ **Result:** You can build charts, animations, and vector-based UIs easily.

---

### 🧩 3. Custom DOM Attributes

React 15 allows unknown attributes to pass through the DOM:

```jsx
<div data-id="42" aria-hidden="true" custom-key="abc" />
```

**Use Cases:**

* Accessibility (`aria-*`)
* Analytics tracking (`data-*`)
* Custom integrations

---

### 📥 4. Input Behavior Fixes

React 15 fixed sync issues in `<input>`, `<radio>`, and `<checkbox>`:

```jsx
<input value={email} onChange={e => setEmail(e.target.value)} />
```

✅ Controlled inputs now behave consistently without focus loss.

---

### 🧪 5. Modular Testing Utilities

React 15 split test tools into:

```bash
npm install react-addons-test-utils
```

* Smaller core bundle
* Dev tools modularized
* Better performance for production

---

### 🚀 6. Performance Boost

Internal updates:

* Reduced memory usage
* Faster diffing algorithm
* Removed legacy paths

✅ Faster rendering and lower memory overhead.

---

### 🧠 7. Better Developer Warnings

Improved error messages like:

> *Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `age` of type `string` supplied to `Profile`, expected `number`.*

✅ Easier debugging, faster development.
